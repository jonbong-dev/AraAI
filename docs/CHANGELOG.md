## [v5.2.0] — 2026-05-23 — Single-job CI pipeline + per-step Comet curves + safety-save

**The HF-push-actually-works release.** v5.1.0 tightened the time budget but a different failure mode kept biting: the runner was SIGTERMed *after* the step-limit print but *before* the model hit disk, leaving the artifact step with nothing to upload. Hugging Face hadn't received a new checkpoint in 8 days even though every training run looked successful in the Actions UI. v5.2 traces the silent failure end-to-end and fixes the four pieces that allowed it to keep happening.

### Single-job pipeline

`meridian-forex.yml` + `meridian-stocks.yml` (four jobs each: setup → train → deploy → cleanup) collapse into one job per workflow (`forex.yml` + `stocks.yml`). The `.pt` never leaves the runner that produced it — no `actions/upload-artifact` + `actions/download-artifact` dance.

Why this matters: in the old layout, when the train step exited 143, the conditional `if: always() && hashFiles(...)` on Upload Model evaluated against an empty `models/` (because the script was killed before save). The artifact never existed, deploy's `actions/download-artifact` raised "Artifact not found", and the HF push silently skipped. In the single-job layout, the Push step runs on the same filesystem the safety-save just wrote to — `hashFiles` succeeds, the upload happens, HF gets the checkpoint even if the train step exited non-zero.

### Safety save before validation

`AdvancedMLSystem.train` now calls `_save_model()` *immediately* when `step_limit_reached` fires, before the 4096-sample CPU validation, before Comet `log_metrics`, before the final `log_model` 132 MB upload. The existing atomic write (`.tmp` + `fsync` + `os.replace`) means this can never produce a truncated checkpoint.

Result: even if the runner is killed during validation or the Comet upload, a valid `.pt` is already on disk and the next step pushes it to HF.

### Per-step Comet metrics

Per-epoch `log_metrics` never fired on 70-step CI runs (an epoch is ~187 optimizer steps, so step-limit always lands mid-first-epoch). The Comet dashboard showed parameters but zero curves. v5.2 logs per optimizer step:

- `step/train_loss` — raw per-step loss
- `step/learning_rate` — current LR from the scheduler
- `step/grad_norm` — pre-clip gradient L2 norm
- `step/elapsed_sec` — seconds since `train_start`

70 data points per run, every run, every project — real training curves on the dashboard at last.

### Per-step CI stdout

Every 5 steps (plus step 1 and the final step) the training loop now prints:

```
  step 5/70 | loss=0.0412 | lr=4.8e-04 | grad=0.831 | t=125s
```

flushed immediately. Live progress in the Actions log instead of one "Step limit reached" line at the end.

### Renames

- Workflows: `meridian-forex.yml` → `forex.yml`, `meridian-stocks.yml` → `stocks.yml`
- Scripts: `train_forex_model.py` → `train_forex.py`, `train_stock_model.py` → `train_stocks.py`, `push_elite_models.py` → `push_to_hf.py`

`git mv` was used so history is preserved.

### No step timeouts on the Train Model step

Only `--max-steps 70` governs when training stops. Job-level cap stays at 360 min (GitHub Actions maximum for public repos). Post-training validation + Comet flush no longer race against a 38- or 55- or 75-minute step deadline.

### Compatibility

State-dict layout is unchanged from v5.1.0. Existing checkpoints load and continue training — no cold restart, no week-long climb back to the current accuracy. `_MIN_LOADABLE` stays at `(4, 1)`.

### Tags

`v5.2.0`, `MeridianModel-2026`, `type:stock|forex`.

## [v5.1.0] — 2026-05-21 — Hardened CI + full Comet telemetry + HF legacy migration

**The reliability release.** Diagnoses and fixes the recurring "The operation was canceled" CI failure, makes every training run fully auditable in Comet, and reorganises the Hugging Face repository so v5 checkpoints live next to a `legacy/` archive of pre-v5 artifacts.

### CI cancellation root-cause fix

The forex/stocks workflows were ending with `Error: The operation was canceled.` at ~44m every run. The training script self-stops at the `--max-time` boundary, but the post-loop **validation + Comet flush + `_save_model`** block was running over the boundary and hanging on either a network call (Comet/HF) or a non-atomic `torch.save`, after which the runner was SIGTERM'd and the EMA checkpoint was lost.

Four-part fix:

1. **SIGTERM/SIGINT handler** in `AdvancedMLSystem.train` — sets a `shutdown_requested` flag the inner step-loop polls. On signal we always break out, run the final save, and exit cleanly. The handler is no-op'd on non-main-thread imports so it doesn't break callers.
2. **Atomic checkpoint write** in `_save_model` — serialises to `<path>.tmp`, `fsync`s, then `os.replace`s into place. A killed runner can no longer leave a half-written `.pt` file.
3. **Comet calls wrapped in `try/except`** — every per-epoch metric log, the one-shot parameter log, and the final summary `experiment.end()` are isolated; a hung HTTP request degrades to a warning instead of stalling the loop.
4. **Tightened time budget** — `--max-time` cut from 45 → 35 minutes; per-step `timeout-minutes: 38` so the runner's own kill arrives *after* the script has gracefully exited.

### Comprehensive Comet ML telemetry

`meridian-ai-stock-v5` and `meridian-ai-forex-v5` projects now receive, per experiment:

- **Dataset audit**: total rows, unique symbols, date range, average rows/symbol, plus a per-symbol `dataset.symbol.<SYM>` other-field with row count and date range, plus a `training_symbols.txt` asset with the symbol list.
- **Architecture summary**: model version, arch name, param count, input size, seq len, dim, layers, heads, KV heads, experts.
- **Training config**: every hyperparameter the run was started with — batch size, effective batch, gradient accumulation steps, LR, weight decay, optimizer, scheduler, loss, EMA decay, validation split, target clip, time/step budgets.
- **Target distribution**: min, max, mean, std, median, percent positive, normalisation mode.
- **Feature stats**: scaler L1 norm, mean of std, data memory footprint.
- **System info**: Python version, torch version, platform, CPU count, total RAM, process RSS.
- **Per-epoch**: train loss, val loss, EMA val loss, LR, direction accuracy, precision, recall, F1, epoch time, total elapsed, gradient norm, weight norm, process RSS, patience counter, best val loss.
- **Final summary**: best val loss, direction accuracy, F1, epochs completed, global steps, training time, whether shutdown was triggered by signal and which one.
- **Tags**: `v5.1.0`, `MeridianModel-2026`, `type:stock|forex`, `params:11M`.

### Hugging Face reorganisation

- Anything below v5 on `meridianal/ARA.AI` moves to `legacy/<filename>`.
- New helper `scripts/migrate_hf_legacy.py` does the inspection/move (idempotent, supports `--dry-run`).
- `scripts/push_elite_models.py` continues to write current models to `models/`.
- Model card refreshed to document the new layout, point at the Comet projects, and list every v5.1 hardening.

### Env handling

- `scripts/train_*.py` and `scripts/push_elite_models.py` accept both CI uppercase secrets (`HF_TOKEN`, `COMET_API_KEY`) **and** the lowercase keys in `.env` (`huggingface_token`, `comet_ai_token`).
- `load_dotenv()` called at script start so local runs work without exporting variables.

### Versions

- `pyproject.toml` and `meridianalgo/__init__.py` bumped to `5.1.0`.
- New constants `MODEL_VERSION = "5.1.0"` and `ARCHITECTURE_NAME = "MeridianModel-2026"` in `large_torch_model.py`; checkpoints saved with these values.
- Loader version check rewritten to compare version tuples (so `"5.1.0"` and `"10.0"` sort correctly).
- `revolutionary_model.py` shim now emits a `DeprecationWarning`; will be removed in v6.

## [v5.0.0] — 2026-05-15 — MeridianModel + Hourly CI

**The correctness release.** Seven silent training bugs fixed, architecture renamed, CI moved to hourly.

### Training bugs fixed

| # | Bug | Symptom | Fix |
|---|-----|---------|-----|
| 1 | Validation ran after `break` | `best_val_loss` always `None`; direction accuracy never recorded | Moved validation block before time-limit break |
| 2 | Double normalisation | Features normalised twice (loader + training loop) | Removed redundant second normalisation pass |
| 3 | FP16 on CPU | `autocast(dtype=float16)` crashes on CPU (no tensor cores) | CPU uses `bfloat16`; `float16` only on CUDA |
| 4 | NaN patience | Early stopping triggered on NaN loss before recovery | `math.isfinite` guard; NaN epochs skip patience counter |
| 5 | Feature saturation | Raw indicators hitting `±1e6` → zero gradients | `torch.clamp(..., -10, 10)` after z-score normalisation |
| 6 | Slow Mamba scan | Python loop over sequence length (~18 min/epoch); hidden state leaked across batches | Batched matrix ops; `h` reset per sample |
| 7 | Hardcoded `use_mamba=True` | Checkpoint always saved `use_mamba=True` regardless of model config | Reads `use_mamba` from the live model layer before saving |

### Architecture rename

- **`MeridianModel`** replaces `RevolutionaryFinancialModel` as the canonical class name
- New file `meridianalgo/meridian_model.py`; `revolutionary_model.py` kept as a zero-breaking backward-compat shim
- Checkpoint version `"5.0"`, architecture string `"MeridianModel-2026"`
- Both old (`"RevolutionaryFinancialModel-2026"`) and new strings accepted on load

### Performance

- **CPU default config**: `dim=256`, `num_heads=4`, `use_mamba=False`, `mamba_state_dim=4` → ~11M params, ~27 min/epoch at 60K samples
- LR warmup: 2-epoch linear ramp (10% → 100%) before cosine annealing — stabilises early training
- Sample cap: 60K most-recent rows (down from 100K) — fits CI window with buffer

### CI

- Training schedule: **every 6 hours → every 1 hour** (stocks at `:00`, forex at `:30`)
- Concurrency groups prevent pile-up; queued runs wait rather than cancel
- `mamba_state_dim` persisted in checkpoint for faithful round-trip reload

### Tests

- `test_architecture_matches_readme` no longer hardcodes `dim=384`/`num_heads=6`/`version="4.1"` — uses range + set checks
- All test files and `conftest.py` import from `meridianalgo.meridian_model`
- `mamba_state_dim` threaded through all test fixtures (defaults to 16 for pre-v5 checkpoints)

## [v4.1.2] — 2026-04-07 — Pipeline fix + lint

- **Fix**: Resolved `UnboundLocalError` on variable `X` after `del` at the metadata-save step — training was succeeding but the run was reported as failed
- **Fix**: Removed unused `mem_model_mb` variable (`ruff F841`)
- **Model card**: Updated Hugging Face model card with correct v4.1 architecture specs

---

## [v4.1.1] — 2025-12-04 — Daily CI + test tagging

- **CI**: Switched training schedule to daily (one run per day per asset type)
- **CI**: 30-minute training cap per run; 60-minute job timeout
